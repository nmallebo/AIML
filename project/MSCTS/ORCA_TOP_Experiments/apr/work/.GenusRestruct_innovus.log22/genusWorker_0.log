  crr_map_def: Performs mapper CRR (critical region resynthesis). Use only for 
               debugging. 

Usage: crr_map_def <design> [-spatial] [-remap_always] [-use_crr_gst]
           [-use_crr_shell]

    <design>:
        the design 
    [-spatial]:
        add spatial settings for DPUL 
    [-remap_always]:
        remap always without checking wns before remapping 
    [-use_crr_gst]:
        use crr_gst in timing optimization 
    [-use_crr_shell]:
        groups all leaf instances in the top design in a crr shell before 
        mapping
